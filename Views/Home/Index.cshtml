            <p style="color: Black; margin-right: 1%">SHIELD Security Services (Pvt) Ltd was formed in October 2004 under Section-32 of the Companies Ordnance Act 1984 (XLVII of 1984) by a group of experienced independent security specialists, who have trained and gained their experience from service within the Armed forces, Police and Civilian security sector.<br>

The aim of SHIELD Security is to provide highly trained, professional, fully vetted and ensured security operatives and teams for an extensive range of specialized security services. Giving total security solutions to both the public and private sectors and ensuring that our clients receive a security and consultancy service second to none.<br>

Security specialists such as Close protection and VIP/Executive security officers are often referred to as "Bodyguards" but the modern day Close Protection officer needs to be more than just the old fashioned "Bodyguard". Executives, VIP’s and Media personalities no longer tolerate the stereotypical untrained "giant" when it comes to personal safety, requiring their personal security operatives to be well mannered, intelligent and able to discreetly deal with any situation should it arise.</p>
